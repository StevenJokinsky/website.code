# Biography
I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Center for Social & Behavior Research](https://csbr.uni.edu) at the University of Northern Iowa. In this position, I work with state and local government officials and other stakeholders to conduct applied policy research and evaluation. I work with my colleagues within CSBR to design, manage, and implement surveys using several modes (e.g., online, self-administered mail, mail-to-online, CATI, and text-to-web) to collect and analyze behavioral and public opinion data that informs public policy. <br/> <!-- LINE BREAK -->

In my research, I examine the political behavior of elites and the general public and how they operate within institutional constraints. I also have research interests centered on survey methodology. My work has been published in *Electoral Studies*, *Election Law Journal*, *Social Science Quarterly*, and *Survey Practice*. <br /> <!-- LINE BREAK -->

I received my Ph.D. in political science from the University of Missouri and completed a B.S. in political science and mathematics from Murray State University.
